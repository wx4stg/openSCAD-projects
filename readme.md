# OpenSCAD projects
----
For a little over 2 years now I have been designing various functional things in OpenSCAD to 3D print.
I have always been too lazy to organize all of my projects into a single directory so that I can publish them on git.

During a recent OS upgrade, I failed to back any of my openSCAD projects up and lost all of them. So now I guess I'll properly git track them.
This repo is public for now but is more of a personal backup than anything. If I ever make something proprietary, I'll make this private, so if you see anything you like, maybe give this repo a clone while you still can?
